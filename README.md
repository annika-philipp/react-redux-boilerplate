# Annika's react-redux-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for starting new tdd projects using React, Redux Webpack, Babel on an Express server. Test folder is set up with two basic tests for App.jsx.

No actions/reducers written yet - apart from a basic combineReducers set up in client/reducers/index.js

# Setup

After cloning this repo

```sh
cd react-redux-boilerplate 
yarn
yarn dev
```

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see the page. Any change to the server will cause a restart and any change to client code will rebuild `bundle.js`.

`BOOM`
